# About us
We are just some student in Grade Seven with some whimsical ideas.\
We are all from China.\
We have our dream and pursuit.\
We believe that \
"Where there is a will there is a way,\
break the caldrons and sink the boats, \
hundreds of Qing's belong to Chu eventually, \
God never ingore hardworking man, \
tolerance the worst for future rise, \
Three thousand of Yue Army could conquer Wu." \
from "Self-encouragement Couplet" by Pu Songling.
